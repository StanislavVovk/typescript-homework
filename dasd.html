                In 1970s London amidst the punk rock revolution,
                a young grifter named Estella is determined to
                make a name for herself with her designs. She
                befriends a pair of young thieves who appreciate
                her appetite for mischief, and together they are
                able to build a life for themselves on the
                London streets. One day, Estella’s flair for
                fashion catches the eye of the Baroness von
                Hellman, a fashion legend who is devastatingly
                chic and terrifyingly haute. But their
                relationship sets in motion a course of events

                embrace her wicked side and become the raucous,
                fashionable and revenge-bent Cruella.

                In 1970s London amidst the punk rock revolution,
                a young grifter named Estella is determined to
                make a name for herself with her designs. She
                befriends a pair of young thieves who appreciate
                her appetite for mischief, and together they are
                able to build a life for themselves on the
                London streets. One day, Estella’s flair for
                fashion catches the eye of the Baroness von
                Hellman, a fashion legend who is devastatingly
                chic and terrifyingly haute. But their
                relationship sets in motion a course of events
                and revelations that will cause Estella to
                embrace her wicked side and become the raucous,
                fashionable and revenge-bent Cruella.
